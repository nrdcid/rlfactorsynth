## Overview

This repository contains a functional implementation of **RLFactorSynth**, a deep reinforcement learning approach to fast unitary synthesis for quantum computing. The project aims to achieve Trasyn-level T-count quality with 10-80× wall-clock speedup through knowledge distillation, efficient neural architectures, and batched GPU inference.

## Key Features Implemented

  - T-count and Clifford count utilities
  
- **unitary.py**: Unitary matrix operations
  - Distance metrics (operator norm, Frobenius, trace)
  - Random unitary generation (Haar measure)
  - Residual computation

## Architecture Highlights

### Factorized State Encoding
The key innovation is representing the synthesis state efficiently:

```
State = {
  Signature Tensor: O(T×d) - Low-rank factorization of residual unitary
  Clifford Tableau: O(n²) - Binary symplectic representation
  Structural Features: O(1) - T-count, depth, gate history
}
```

This reduces memory from O(2^(2n)) to O(Td + n²), enabling larger circuits and batch processing.

### Transformer Architecture
```
Input: Factorized State
  ↓
Encoders (Signature, Tableau, Features)
  ↓
Fusion Layer (768-dim)
  ↓
4-layer Transformer (8 heads, 2048 FFN)
  ↓
Policy Head (masked softmax) + Value Head
```

### Training Pipeline
```
1. Generate expert trajectories (heuristic beam search)
2. Imitation learning (distillation)
3. PPO fine-tuning with curriculum learning
4. Online distillation on hard instances
```

## What's Included

* **Complete repository structure**
* **Core quantum primitives**
* **Factorized state encoding**
* **RL environment with action masking**
* **Transformer policy architecture**
* **PPO training implementation**
* **Inference scripts**
* **Configuration system (Hydra)**
* **Unit tests**
* **Documentation and README**
* **Docker support**
* **Makefile for common commands**

## What's Simplified/Placeholder

* **Meta-actions library**: Currently has placeholder examples. Full implementation would mine frequent patterns from Trasyn enumeration.

* **Expert policy**: Uses simplified heuristic beam search instead of full Trasyn integration.

* **Batched environment**: Single environment implemented; vectorized batch environment would require additional work.

* **Benchmark datasets**: Interface provided but actual Trasyn 187 circuits would need to be loaded separately.

* **Multi-qubit support**: Architecture supports it but needs more testing and optimization.

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Implement meta-actions library**:
   - Mine frequent gate patterns from expert trajectories
   - Add hardware-specific fusions (T-T-T-T → S-S)
   - Precompute optimal Rz(θ) decompositions

2. **Integrate real expert policy**:
   - Interface with Trasyn or implement gridsynth
   - Generate high-quality training data
   - Implement knowledge distillation loss

3. **Add batched environment**:
   - Vectorize environment operations
   - GPU-accelerated state updates
   - Parallel unitary synthesis

4. **Implement evaluation suite**:
   - Load benchmark circuits (Trasyn 187, etc.)
   - Compute quality metrics vs. baselines
   - Generate comparison plots

5. **Add ablation studies**:
   - FFNN vs. Transformer
   - Factorized vs. raw encoding
   - Different curriculum schedules

6. **Optimize for production**:
   - Model quantization
   - ONNX export
   - Inference optimization
